# Click the Truck game. 
Click the Truck is a memory game that was built using the React.js framework. 

The objective of the game is for the player to click on each truck only once. 
The truck images are re-shuffled each time the player clicks on a truck. 
When the player clicks on a truck for the first time, they earn 1 point. 
If the player clicks on a truck for a second time, the player's score is reset to 0. 
The player who earns the top score of 12 points wins the game. 

##Setup Instructions:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The game uses several npm packages. To install these packages, navigate to your project folder and type:

```yarn install```

Please refer to the README generated with the Create React App for instructions on deploying the game to GitHub pages. 

This project is very useful because it gave the developer an understanding of how the React.js framework works. 

Currently, only the original developer maintains and contributes to this project.
